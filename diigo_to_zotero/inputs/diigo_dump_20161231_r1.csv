The generator only runs when the player enters a new level, so it doesn't have to be as super fast,Highlight:connectedHighlight:want dungeons to not be perfect. 'Perfect' in the context of mazes and graphs (which are synonymous) means there is only one path between any two points. If you flatten out all of the windy passages, you'll discover your twisty maze is really just a tree all crumpled up. Passageways branch but never merge. Im-perfect mazes have loops and cycles''multiple paths from A to B.Highlight:multiple distinct dungeon generation algorithms. Outdoor areas use an entirely different process. (I should probably write about that too sometime. Look, another unfulfilled promise!)  But coding a new dungeon generator from scratch for every area is a huge time sink.Highlight:I do a fixed number of attempts to place rooms. Failure becomes more common as the dungeon gets fuller''after all, you can only fit so many rooms in a given area''but tuning this gives you some control over room density, like so:Highlight:t picks a pair of rooms''completely ignoring how far apart they are''and starts a passageway that wanders randomly from one (hopefully) to the other. It's got a few clever checks to keep things from overlapping too much but passageways can and do cut through other rooms, cross other passages or dead end.Highlight:description of a dungeon generatorHighlight:he /r/roguelikedev subredditHighlight:The magic step, and the piece I was missing, is sparseness. A normal maze fills every single square of the world, leaving no areas where you can fit a room. The trick that Jamis and FastAsUcan do here is to carve the whole maze and then uncarve the dead ends.Highlight:Once you do that, you can start placing rooms. The process Jamis uses for this is interesting. He picks a room size and then tries to place it on every single location in the dungeon. Any location that overlaps a room or passageway is discarded. The remaining positions are 'ranked' where rooms that are near passageways are better. It then picks the best position and places the room there, and puts some doors between the room and the passage.Highlight:Where Buck and Karcero start with the maze and then add the rooms, mine does things in the opposite order. First, it places a bunch of random rooms. Then, it iterates over every tile in the dungeon. When it finds a solid one where an open area could be, it starts running a maze generator at that point.Highlight:After filling in the rooms and mazes, we find all of those possible connectors. These are tiles that are:      Solid rock.        Adjacent to two regions of different colors.
