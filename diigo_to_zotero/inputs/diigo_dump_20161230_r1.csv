A normal maze fills every single square of the world, leaving no areas where you can fit a room. The trick that Jamis and FastAsUcan do here is to carve the whole maze and then uncarve the dead ends.Highlight:Once you do that, you can start placing rooms. The process Jamis uses for this is interesting. He picks a room size and then tries to place it on every single location in the dungeon. Any location that overlaps a room or passageway is discarded. The remaining positions are 'ranked' where rooms that are near passageways are better. It then picks the best position and places the room there, and puts some doors between the room and the passage.Highlight:Where Buck and Karcero start with the maze and then add the rooms, mine does things in the opposite order. First, it places a bunch of random rooms. Then, it iterates over every tile in the dungeon. When it finds a solid one where an open area could be, it starts running a maze generator at that point.Highlight:After filling in the rooms and mazes, we find all of those possible connectors.

Web Page,The Shrinking World of Ideas - The Chronicle Review - The Chronicle of Higher Education,http://chronicle.com/article/Neuroscience-Is-Ruining-the/150141/,"philosophy,editorial,academic","Highlight:Trilling belonged to a culture dominated by New York Intellectuals, French writers, and British critics and philosophers, most of whom had been marked by the Second World War and the charged political atmosphere of the burgeoning Cold War. Nothing seemed more crucial than weighing the importance of individual freedom against the importance of the collective good, or of deciding which books best reflected the social consciousness of an age when intellectual choices could mean life or death. And because of this overarching concern, the interpretation of poetry, fiction, history, and philosophy wasn't just an exercise in analysis but testified to one's moral view of the world.Highlight:Art and literature survived the onslaught of critical theory, but not without a major derailment. The banal, the ordinary, the popular became both the focus and the conduit of aesthetic expression. This may be something of an exaggeration, but it's hard not to view the work of John Cage, Andy Warhol, and Alain Robbe-Grillet as compositions less interested in art than in the conceit that anything could be art. And while this attempt to validate the ordinary may have been in step with the intellectual tempo, it also summoned from the academy an exegesis so abstruse,Highlight:This may be the reason that there are no more schools of thought in the humanities as we once understood them. Obviously one can still learn about the tenets of the Frankfurt School and Prague School in courses across the country, just as one can study the works of Marxist and psychoanalytic critics (Althusser, Lacan, Deleuze, Lyotard, Marcuse, Norman O. Brown) and the deconstructionist writings of Derrida and de Man''Highlight:For when literature professors began to apply critical theory to the teaching of books they were, in effect, committing suicide by theory.Highlight:what the postmodernists indirectly accomplished was to open the humanities to the sciences, particularly neuroscience. By exposing the ideological codes in language, by revealing the secret grammar of architectural narrative and poetic symmetries, and by identifying the biases that frame 'disinterested' judgment, postmodern theorists provided a blueprint of how we necessarily think and express ourselves.Highlight:'The Seductive Allure of Neuroscience Explanations,' Deena Skolnick Weisberg and colleagues demonstrated that ordinary people's opinions were so influenced by neuroscientific terms that any explanation or critical judgment employing them seemed valid, however nonsensical. Well, professors of English and philosophy are ordinary people, too.Highlight:And it's precisely because Trilling and T.S. Eliot were the high priests of modernism and Derrida the iconic trickster of postmodernism that we're forced to acknowledge that no literary or philosophical thinker has arisen to take their place.Highlight:ccording to William Deresiewicz's recent book Excellent Sheep: The Miseducation of the American Elite and the Way to a Meaningful Life, the proportion of students majoring in English declined to 3 percent in 2011-12, less than half of what it had been 40 years ago.Highlight:Since the beginning of the 19th century, the intellectual world has not been so much one world as a hazy, obscure planet around which various well-marked satellites circle, each believing its rotation comes closest to illuminating the hidden undifferentiated surface. These smaller, self-contained entities, whether they were of the scientific, scholarly, or belletrist kind, were for the most part intolerant of one another, their orbits tracing dissimilar points of view. The bifurcation of knowledge that emerged during the Enlightenment, when philosophers argued that universal truths could be gleaned through study and reason, continued apace until scientist, classicist, theologian, economist, and alienist could no longer converse profitably about their respective fields. But except for the most introverted, tunnel-vision thinkers, intellectuals still met and collided on ideological grounds. The meaning of life, the ethical way to live, the moral makeup of society, the rights of the individual, the good of the community, the role of art, were issues that engrossed all thoughtful people.Highlight:The not-so-wonderful irony of the postmodern program was that its theoretic rigor and forceful determination to get to the bottom of things precipitated a great falling off in cultural life. Although we can't quite return to the 'innocence' of modernism (never mind its many supple and complicated byways), we've also lost our appetite for locating hidden modalities in art and literature. Yet art and literature still have a place in our lives. How to explain it without resorting to the assumptive modes of criticism that the postmodernists did their best to undermine? This perceived stasis of nowhere-to-go is leading humanists back to old-fashioned methods of relying on the hard data and empirical certainty of scientific research.",1/12/2015 5:42,The Shrinking World of Ideas - The Chronicle Review - The Chronicle of Higher Education,D:/Dropbox/PyProjects/Citation Scraper/outputs/Live forever Scientists say they'll extend life 'well beyond 120'  Science  The Guardian.pdf,D:/Dropbox/PyProjects/Citation Scraper/outputs/Live forever Scientists say they'll extend life 'well beyond 120'  Science  The Guardian.html

Hunt, a twentieth-century composition researcher. AT-unit consists of a main clause and all of its modifiers, including anyembedded or attached clauses, so that 'cutting a passage into T-unitswill be cutting it into the shortest units which it is grammaticallyallowable to punctuate as sentences' (Hunt, 'Syntactic' 4).Highlight:n addition, T-unit length can serve as a measure of syntactic complexityand cognitive maturity in a writer or author. Less-experienced writerstend to conjoin shorter sentences in a paratactic style, while skilledwriters tend to combine sentences into longer main clauses withsubordinate dependent clauses in a hypotactic style:Paratactic: Emily went to Amherst Academy [5], and she went to MountHolyoke College [7].Hypotactic: After Emily went to Amherst Academy, she went to MountHolyoke College (12).The paratactic sentence has two short T-units, with five words in onemain clause and seven words in the other, for an average of six wordsper T-unit. The hypotactic sentence has one medium-length T-unit, withtwelve words in the main clause plus modifying clause. Short T-unitsconsist of one to eight words per sentence; medium-length T-units containnine to twenty words per sentence; while long T-units have twenty-oneor morewords per sentence (Hunt, 'Grammatical' 30). Younger writersand less educated writers tend to use more short T-units than advancedwriters. Advanced writers also use some short T-units, but they havemore medium and long sentences because they add more phrasal modifiers,and they embed or attach more dependent clauses.Highlight:since poetry is often more abridged than prose, and sinceDickinson is famous for the lyrical brevity of her style, her averagesentence length might naturally be shorter than average sentence lengthin a novel.

I talked only about the UK because this is what the article is about.And it would be nice if these western imperial powers stopped denying their history and glorifying their empires. After all, all these empires were based on the Nazi-like imperialist ideology 'us superior, them inferior'. The UK and other imperial powers never paid reparations for the huge damage they have caused to their former colonies. The oppressed nations still live with the consequences.I am Slovene, so my nation was on the receiving end in this game of empires. We were occupied and exploited by Germans/Austrians for more than a thousand years. In essence, we were an Austrian colony. (Austrians are our neighbours on the continent and for some strange reason the term 'colony' in not used in this context.)Due to Austrian oppression, we had no Slovene aristocracy. Land was owned by Austrians. We also had no representation in Vienna. We were not allowed to have a university in our language - Slovenes studied in Vienna, usually in poverty. Slovenes were mostly poor peasants. In the second half of the 19th century, we established some meagre bourgeois (owners of small factories etc.), but they were certainly not excessively rich. Slovenes demanded several times some autonomy (the concept known as 'United Slovenia'), but these requests were turned down by Vienna.People sometimes claim that empires were good because they built infrastructure on the occupied territories. They did, but to satisfy the interests of the foreign master and not to advance the occupied nation. The infrastructure supported more effective exploitation and increased profits of the imperialists. For example, the Austrian Empire built a railway Vienna-Trieste, which runs through Slovenia. But they did it because Austria is landlocked, and Trieste (which was then a predominantly Slovene city) was its port on the Mediterranean coast.The Austrian Empire broke up in 1918, after WWI. Slovenia ended up in what eventually became Yugoslavia. Already in 1919, immediately after we gained national autonomy as a part of Yugoslavia, we established the first Slovene university.But only two thirds of Slovenes were lucky enough to end up in Yugoslavia after WWI. Namely, during WWI the UK had a sinister secret deal with Italy using western Slovenia as a bribe (!) to lure Italy to enter the war on the UK side (the London agreement - almost exactly 100 years ago). Mussolini rose to power in Italy (also with the UK support), and his fascists whom we called 'black beasts' terrorised Slovenes as an 'inferior' nation for more than twenty years, until capitulation of Italy in 1943. Their attempted ethnic cleansing included a total prohibition of the use of Slovene language (also in schools and churches), prohibition of all Slovene economic and cultural organisations, forceful changing Slovenes names and surnames to Italian names, a third of Slovenes fled from Italy as refugees to escape the terror (mostly to Yugoslavia and South America) etc. Again, rather bad conditions for effective education of Slovenes.Slovene Academy of Sciences (= our 'Royal Society') was established in 1938 in the Yugoslav part of Slovenia. And then WWII came, and Slovenia was ripped apart in 1941 by three occupying powers: Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and fascist Hungary. So more terror and oppression and ethnic cleansing throughout Slovenia'¦ Use of our language was prohibited. The Slovene partisans (official members of the Allied Forces) fought the occupiers and established schools in Slovene language on the liberated territories.Slovenia lost about 9% of the population in WWII. After the war, Slovenia was demolished and there was a lot of building to do, which was work-intensive and expensive. Among other things, we also had to build a new port for Slovenia, because the UK kindly handed over Trieste (again!) to Hitler's close ally Italy. We also had to re-establish our education system. So historically we were pushed back to square one again and again.Of course Slovenia is a very small nation, and the size of a nation certainly also matters in relation to success of science and the number of scientists. But the above described case of Slovenia's historical circumstances illustrates the impact of imperialism and oppression in general on the target nations. The consequences of historical events cast very long shadows.In my opinion, national freedom and resources (wealth) were/are major factors in development of national science.---PS: In my opinion, the greatest achievement of my nation is that we somehow managed to survive and keep our language and culture alive through all these storms of history. We had little time and resources to think about science. :-)'",7/14/2015 15:52,Beware Eurosceptic versions of history and science Rebekah Higgitt  Science  The Guardian,D:/Dropbox/PyProjects/Citation Scraper/outputs/America's Justice System Sure Doesn't Know Much Science  WIRED.pdf,D:/Dropbox/PyProjects/Citation Scraper/outputs/America's Justice System Sure Doesn't Know Much Science  WIRED.html

However, 12-step recovery groups encourage lifelong participation that includes meetings, service committees, and helping other recovering addicts.

Indeed, the cultural profile of the alcoholic is male, which in turn animates the social taboo about the woman who drinks too much.

This assumption bought into the liberal capitalist idea that the size of the share of the economic pie available to workers is fixed and highly limited, and that different sub-groups of workers must fight against each other to expand their shares.Highlight:Privilege theory's focus on assumptions of worker and personal complicity leads to a strategy of combating racism and oppression through individual evolution: self-renunciation, engaging in consciousness-raising discussions, developing deeper understandings of our different experiences, and attempting to change the operation of 'privilege' in interpersonal dynamics.Highlight:Modern privilege theory reflects the lack of class politics that has come to characterize the country and the left, despite increased popular awareness of the role of the 1 Percent (as evidenced by Occupy, Wisconsin, the Fight for 15, and other events)Highlight:The politics of privilege have come full circle. The privilege ideology circuit began among Stalinists, who brought privilege politics into the middle-class student movement, with common prejudices against workers, as part of the orgy of self-destruction of the New Left in the late 1960s. Ex-student radicals then carried privilege theory into the universities. There, it was perceived to be part of the legacy of the left, and accepted by liberals as a way to oppose racism that required no action in the real world. Privilege theory became the dominant discourse of many departments and university administrations, evolving and moving to the right (dropping, for example, both anti-imperialism and talk of revolution), as it accommodated the rightward shift and drift in American political and intellectual life.

Web Page,A Grammar-Based Semantic Similarity Algorithm for Natural Language Sentences,http://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2014/437162/,"semantic,algorithm,natural,language,similarity,sentiment analysis","Highlight:An artificial language is often characterized by self-created vocabularies, strict grammar, and a limited ideographic range and therefore belongs to a linguistic category that is less easy to be accustomed to, yet not difficult to be mastered by the general public. A natural language is inseparable from the entire social culture and varies constantly over time; individuals can easily develop a sense of this first language while growing up. In addition, the syntactic and semantic flexibility of a natural language enables this type of language to be natural to human beings. However, due to its endless exceptions, changes, and indications, a natural language also becomes the type of language that is the most difficult to be mastered.Highlight:techniques for detecting similarity between texts have centered on developing document models. In recent years, several types of document models have been established, such as the Boolean model, the vector-based model, and the statistical probability modelHighlight:The primary contribution of this method was in suggesting the concepts of partial comparison and similarity, so that the system can calculate the similarity between a document and a query based on the different weights of index termsHighlight:Concerning the actualization of a vector model, first users' queries and documents in a database should be transformed into vectors in the same dimension. While both the documents and queries are represented by the same vector space dimension, the most common evaluation on semantic similarity in a high dimensional space is to calculate the similarity between two vectors using cosine, whose value should fall between 0 and 1.Highlight:Recently, a concept under development emphasizes that the similarity between texts is the 'latent semantic analysis (LSA), which is based on the statistical data of vocabulary in a large corpusHighlight:LSA, also known as latent semantic indexing (LSI), is a fully automatic mathematical/statistical technique that analyzes a large corpus of natural language text and a similarity representation of words and text passagesHighlight:The conventional methods assume that a document has hundreds or thousands of dimensions, transferring the short texts/sentences into a very high dimensional space and extremely sparse vectors may lead to a less accurate calculation resultHighlight:Algorithms based on shared terms are suitable to be applied to the retrieval of medium and longer texts that contain more information. In contrast, information of shared terms in short texts or sentences is rare and even inaccessible. This may cause the system to generate a very low score on semantic similarity, and this result cannot be adjusted by a general smoothing function.(3)Stopwords are usually not taken into consideration in the indexing of normal IR systems. Stopwords do not have much meaning when calculating the similarity between longer texts. However, they are unavoidable parts with regard to the similarity between sentences, for that they deliver information concerning the structure of sentences, which has a certain degree of impact on explaining the meanings of sentences.(4)Similar sentences may be composed of synonyms; abundant shared terms are not necessary. Current studies evaluate similarity according to the cooccurring terms in the texts and ignore syntactic information.Highlight:latent semantic",1/17/2016 18:05,A Grammar-Based Semantic Similarity Algorithm for Natural Language Sentences,D:/Dropbox/PyProjects/Citation Scraper/outputs/R FAQ How can I subset a data set.pdf,D:/Dropbox/PyProjects/Citation Scraper/outputs/R FAQ How can I subset a data set.html

That ad barrage pushed his poll numbers in the state from about 9 percent to about 8 percentHighlight:From Jupiter Island, Florida, to Greenwich, Connecticut; from Dallas's Highland Park to Sea Island, Georgia; from Fifth Avenue in Manhattan to California's Newport Beach, the baffled question resounded: What went wrongHighlight:Something has changed in American politics since the Great Recession. The old slogans ring hollow. The insurgent candidates are less absurd, the orthodox candidates more vulnerable. The GOP donor elite planned a dynastic restoration in 2016. Instead, it triggered an internal class warHighlight:Maybe Jeb Bush has just been a bad candidate with a radioactive last name. Maybe the same message and platform would have worked fine if espoused by a fresher and livelier candidate. Such is the theory of Marco Rubio's campaignHighlight:maybe $100 million in negative ads can scorch any potential alternative, enabling the donor-backed candidate to win by defaultHighlight:Carson may say wacky things, but he does not say heterodox thingsHighlight:Immigration is not the main reason Republican presidential candidates lose so badly among Latino and Asian American voters, and never was: Latino voters are more likely to list education and health care as issues that are extremely important to them. A majority of Asian Americans are non-Christian and susceptible to exclusion by sectarian religious themesHighlight:Perhaps some concession to the disgruntled base is needed. That's the theory of the Cruz campaign and''after a course correction''also of the Christie campaign. Instead of 2013's 'Conservatism Classic Plus Immigration Liberalization,' Cruz and Christie are urging 'Conservatism Classic Plus Immigration EnforcementHighlight:Yet a narrow focus on immigration populism alone seems insufficient to raise Republican hopes. Trump shrewdly joins his immigration populism to trade populism. On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders's opposition to open borders is logically connected to his hopes for a Democratic Socialist future: His admired Denmark upholds high labor standards along with some of the world's toughest immigration rulesHighlight:Remember that Republican voters care more about aligning government with their values of work and family than they care about cutting the size of government as an end in itselfHighlight:Recognize that the gimmick of mobilizing the base with culture-war outrages stopped working at least a decade agoHighlight:Such a party would cut health-care costs by squeezing providers, not young beneficiaries. It would boost productivity by investing in hard infrastructure''bridges, airports, water-treatment plants. It would restore Dwight Eisenhower to the Republican pantheon alongside Ronald Reagan and emphasize the center in center-rightHighlight:How partisans feel about process issues is notoriously related to what process would benefit them at any given moment. Liberals loved the interventionist Supreme Court in the 1960s and '70s, hated it in the 1990s and 2000s",2/23/2016 5:04,Will the Republican Party Survive the 2016 Election - The Atlantic,D:/Dropbox/PyProjects/Citation Scraper/outputs/From Webcam to Planetcam Planetary Imaging on the Cheap - Universe Today.pdf,D:/Dropbox/PyProjects/Citation Scraper/outputs/From Webcam to Planetcam Planetary Imaging on the Cheap - Universe Today.html

But it's also supposed to lift students out of their circumstances, diminishing difference.Highlight:They move their lives to rural Ohio and perform their identities, whatever that might mean. They bear out the school's vision. In exchange, they're groomed for old-school entry into the liberal upper middle class. An irony surrounds the whole endeavor, and a lot of students seemed to see it.Highlight:A quad-size version of this drama is unfolding. 'This is the generation of kids that grew up being told that the nation was basically over race,' Renee Romano, a professor of history at Oberlin, says. When they were eleven or twelve, Barack Obama was elected President, and people hailed this as a national-historic moment that changed everything. 'That's the bill of goods they've been sold,' Romano explains. 'And, as they get older, they go, 'This is crap! It's not true!'&nbsp;' They saw the deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice. And, at schools like Oberlin, they noticed that the warm abstractions of liberalism weren't connecting with the way things operated on the ground.Highlight:He says that he lobbied his department for years to hire a scholar of East Asian theatre to help balance out his Western expertise. Instead, he sees a game of retitling courses and bowing to complaints in a transparent attempt to appease the college's crucial customers: the students.Highlight:Marc Blecher, an Oberlin professor of politics, had problems with the program at the time, in part, he said, because thinking in terms of cultural identities often leaves out a critical factor: class. He believes the problem goes back to the early days of boomer politics, which he experienced as an activist at Cornell, in the sixties. 'When we opposed the Vietnam War, we didn't take seriously that all the draft dodging we were doing was screwing black people and poor people and forcing them to go fight,'Highlight:Class was seldom fully in the mix, except, maybe, in a generalized Marxist way. Blecher suggests that this is how we ended up with market-friendly multiculturalism and, in universities, an almost consumerist conception of identity politics.Highlight:I literally am so tired of learning about Marx, when he did not include race in his discussion of the market!Highlight:'The capitalist process,' Acey goes on. 'We go through this professionalization through the university. And this professionalization is to work really unnecessary jobs.' 'When I came here, I'm, like, 'Where are the people who are disabled?'&nbsp;' Adams says. 'I know so many disabled people at home.'

It was later reported that Trump's plan had been to seat the women in the Trump family box, and to have them confront Bill Clinton as they all entered the hall, but the debate managers got wind of this and thwarted that part of the juvenile trick.

This was a place cut off both from western Europe and the east. You had to travel hundreds of miles across East Germany on an autobahn corridor just to get there. It attracted every kind of draft dodger, druggie and dropout from West Germany. Once they got there hardly anybody ever left. This was partly because the place was flooded with hard drugs, mainly heroin, allegedly made in illegal labs in the east. If you were a young person in West Berlin in the 1970s and 1980s it was very hard not to come into contact with these drugs, or end up like Christiane FHighlight:'Back in the UK in the late 70s everyone was popping amphetamines and jumping around to punk.

The heroin in Paris then came from Indochina, via Turkey, and was brought into Marseille by the Corsican gangs who would later be known as the French Connection.

Ludology. In all its latinate glory, it imposes a kind of seriousness upon this then-even-more-unseemly act of studying videogames for a living.Highlight:Yet shifting the frame of 'narratology' hid the real agenda: a move toward a formalist rather than functionalist approach to the study of games. In this sense, Frasca's title, 'Ludology meets Narratology' offers the first shadow of the wool as it was pulled over our collective eyes: such a 'meeting' shouldn't have seemed surprising at all.Highlight:The idea of one formalist analytical method meeting another is more like an attorney reinventing himself as a legislator than it is like a mime transforming into a urologistHighlight:By pitting one kind of formalism against another, the result became a foregone conclusion: formalism wins.Highlight:Espen AarsethHighlight:Michael MateasHighlight:When all else is stripped away from a game, says Aarseth, 'the rules remain.'

The same is certainly true of a number of popular accounts of game design, including those of Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman, and of Tracy Fullerton.Highlight:Montfort and I set out to draw a distinction: videogames are computational artifacts whose understanding demands at least partial mastery of the architecture of computersHighlight:each videogame is a particular piece of software created and run on a particular piece of computer hardware, at a particular moment in time. Individually and together, these software and hardware systems exert pressure on one another, extending backward toward inspiration and influence and forward toward convention and genreHighlight:In short, we suggested that a major, perhaps even primary feature of computational media arises from the constraints of hardware and software design.Highlight:code studiesHighlight:Often, we suggest, effective studies of new media will draw from multiple levels of this model. But more strongly, we argue that the level of analysis we call platform is both a promising and underexplored aspect of new media scholarship.Highlight:Some call it technological determinism, but a more nuanced gripe might accuse us of scientific naturalism instead. For naturalists, the world amounts to sets of ever more fundamental, ever smaller things and parts, and the really-real amounts to the most fundamentalHighlight:As it is relevant to my interests, this critique involves two related moves: first, a rejection of idealism and a reassertion of realism. And second, an expansion of the concern of being beyond the human.Highlight:For Heidegger, objects are outside of human consciousness, but their being exists only in human understandingHighlight:The linguistic turn of mid-twentieth century philosophy continued the preference for consciousness inaugurated by phenomenology, but transitioned that conceit to languageHighlight:Human culture is allowed to be multifarious and complex, but the natural or material world is only ever permitted to be singular.Highlight:flat ontology. This is a term that first occurs in the work of Manuel DeLanda, who uses it to refer to an ontology comprised entirely of individuals (rather than species and genera, for example)Highlight:we accept Harman and Bryant's invitation to flatten the ontological field, such that all objects are on equal footing, the result is a plane of indiscriminate differences, in which all aspects of a game's existence have the same potential to matterHighlight:E.T. is 8 kilobytes of 6502 opcodes and operands, which you can see in a hex dump of the ROM itself [in the presentation, I listed the full hex dump on-screen]. Each value corresponds with a processor operation, some of which also take operands. For example hex $69 is the opcode for adding a value.Highlight:Latour calls it irreduction: 'nothing can be reduced to anything else,' even if certain aspects of a thing could be considered transformative upon something else.Highlight:the Scylla of correlationism, a common problem with media studies and social scientific analyses of games, and the Charybdis of reductionism, one of the common critiques of formal and material analyses of gamesHighlight:Likewise E.T. is never only one of the things just mentioned, nor is it only a collection of all of these things. Paradoxically, a flattened ontology allows it to be both and neither.
